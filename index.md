# Free Online Street Photography Course
Adapted from [All the Worldâ€™s a Stage: Introduction to Street Photography](http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2014/02/04/free-open-source-online-street-photography-course-all-the-worlds-a-stage-introduction-to-street-photography/) by [Eric Kim](http://erickimphotography.com)

## Objectives

In this hybrid course, you will explore how to shoot street photography and how to interact with your subjects through readings, photos, videos, journals, and social experiments. Sociological theory will be used as a backbone for the concepts taught in the course, and your full participation (online and offline) is essential for gaining a personally enriching experience from the course.

How do you overcome the fear of shooting street photography and how do you create images that tell compelling stories? By the end of the course, you will build your confidence shooting on the streets, learn about the work of classic and contemporary street photographers, and understand the sociological impact of your images.

## Course Materials

For this course you will need a camera for the weekly assignments. It is preferable that you use a digital camera, as it will make it easier for you to quickly upload your weekly assignments. However if you prefer to shoot with film, simply make sure you can process your film and scan it each week.

The only text that will be necessary to purchase is listed below. All the other texts, articles, and videos will be available online.
